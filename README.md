# Day 4
There are two directories:
- `project`
- `project-code-along`

## Project-Code-Along
This directory contains an example code along where we utilize the different JavaScript concepts and add our NPM and CLI skills to code out a CLI game. 

## Project
This directory is where the prompts and requirements for the project you will be working on and building.
